# PostMa'am
Simple Mac HTTP Request Maker.

Sometimes you just want to try an HTTP request without having to think through curl or waiting for a crappy Electron app to launch.

PostMa'am aims to be a "[Mac-Assed Mac App](https://twitter.com/collindonnell)". No cross platform funny business. Tiny app bundle size. Launches in microseconds. No Electron. No SaaS growth hacking.
